To open a php file in chrome, I 
downloaded MAMP and from the prefrences, go to
port, and in there set Apache to 8888.
Also, make sure in Web Server you select Apache.

After that, you can just open a chrome tab, type
"localhost:8888" (without quotations) and you
should see the upload stuff... :)
